# Personal-Website

A dashboard website, in SvelteKit, which is easily expandible through modules.
First module is supposed to be a Todo client with programming projects to replace the next section in this file.

## Todo

  - Modules Folder in Routing 
  - In modules folder with each individual module, each consisting of its own index.html
- Connect to python Api
